# Mistral-RAG-PDF-READER
Large Language Models (LLMs) are shown to learn substantial amount of knowledge
from the data and they can do so without accessing any external memory. These models
have some downsides: Their memory cannot be easily changed or revised, i.e. adding to
the memory is not an easy task, they cannot provide straight forward insights in their
answers or “predictions” and are prone to “hallucinations”. LLM Hallucination is. When
the model is able to produce coherent and grammatically correct response but factually it
is incorrect or misleading. Hallucination in the context of LLMs means generation of
false or misleading information.This is the reason RAG was developed. RAG, or
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a model architecture that integrates elements from
both retrieval-based and generative-based approaches to natural language processing
(NLP).This hybrid-based method was introduced to improve the quality and relevance of
generated text by leveraging information retrieval techniques. Hybrid models can address
some of these issues because the knowledge is directly revised and added to. Its
knowledge can be inspected and fact-checked. The primary goal of this project is to develop a Streamlit application that will allow users
to upload their own PDF files and interact with the contents of those files through a
conversational interface. It aims to develop a robust and user-friendly application that
can handle a variety of tasks related to PDF document interaction. The code is available on GitHub for reference:
